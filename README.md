# IDS Using Federated Reinforcement Learning
This project tackles Intrusion detection system as a Reinforcement Learning problem.  
We develop an IDS using reinforcement learning algorithms such as DDQN and Dueling DQN.
We use flwr to emulate a federated environment and run the IDS on several clients and use various techniques to aggregate the results.
